    "# Notes\n",
    "At many points in your career, you'll need to be able to build complete, end-to-end data science projects on your own. Data science projects usually consist of one of two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "- An exploration and analysis of a set of data. One example might involve analyzing donors to political campaigns, creating a plot, and then sharing an analysis of the plot with others.\n",
    "- An operational system that generates predictions based on data that updates continually. An algorithm that pulls in daily stock ticker data and predicts which stock prices will rise and fall would be one example.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll find the ability to create data science projects useful in several different contexts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Projects will help you build a portfolio, which is critical to finding a job as a data analyst or scientist.\n",
    "- Working on projects will help you learn new skills and reinforce existing concepts.\n",
    "- Most \"real-world\" data science and analysis work consists of developing internal projects.\n",
    "- Projects allow you to investigate interesting phenomena and satisfy your curiosity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether you aim to become a data scientist or analyst or you're just curious about the world, building projects can be immensely rewarding.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Here's](https://github.com/dataquestio/loan-prediction) an example of a finished project.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this mission, we'll walk through the first part of a complete data science project, including how to acquire the raw data. The project will focus on exploring and analyzing a data set. We'll develop our data cleaning and storytelling skills, which will enable us to build complete projects on our own.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll focus primarily on data exploration in this mission. We'll also combine several messy data sets into a single clean one to make analysis easier. Over the next few missions, we'll work through the rest of our project and perform the actual analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are two ways to go about finding a good topic:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Think about what sectors or angles you're really interested in, then find data sets relating to those sectors.\n",
    "- Review several data sets, and find one that seems interesting enough to explore.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whichever approach you take, you can start your search at these sites:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Data.gov` - A directory of government data downloads\n",
    "- `/r/datasets` - A subreddit that has hundreds of interesting data sets\n",
    "- `Awesome datasets` - A list of data sets hosted on GitHub\n",
    "- `rs.io` - A great blog post with hundreds of interesting data sets\n",
    "\n",
    "In real-world data science, you may not find an ideal data set. You might have to aggregate disparate data sources instead, or do a good amount of data cleaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of this project, we'll be using data about New York City public schools, which can be found [here](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/browse?category=Education).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've chosen a topic, you'll want to pick an angle to investigate. It's important to choose an angle that has enough depth to analyze, but isn't so complicated that it's difficult to get started. You want to finish the project, and you want your results to be interesting to others.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most controversial issues in the U.S. educational system is the efficacy of standardized tests, and whether they're unfair to certain groups. Given our prior knowledge of this topic, investigating the correlations between SAT scores and demographics might be an interesting angle to take. We could correlate [SAT scores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAT) with factors like race, gender, income, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SAT, or Scholastic Aptitude Test, is an exam that U.S. high school students take before applying to college. Colleges take the test scores into account when deciding who to admit, so it's fairly important to perform well on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The test consists of three sections, each of which has 800 possible points. The combined score is out of 2,400 possible points (while this number has changed a few times, the data set for our project is based on 2,400 total points). Organizations often rank high schools by their average SAT scores. The scores are also considered a measure of overall school district quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "New York City makes its [data on high school SAT scores](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2012-SAT-Results/f9bf-2cp4) available online, as well as the [demographics for each high school](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2014-2015-DOE-High-School-Directory/n3p6-zve2). The first few rows of the SAT data look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, combining both of the data sets won't give us all of the demographic information we want to use. We'll need to supplement our data with other sources to do our full analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same website has several related data sets covering demographic information and test scores. Here are the links to all of the data sets we'll be using:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [`SAT scores by school`](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2012-SAT-Results/f9bf-2cp4) - SAT scores for each high school in New York City\n",
    "- [`School attendance`](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2010-2011-School-Attendance-and-Enrollment-Statist/7z8d-msnt) - Attendance information for each school in New York City\n",
    "- [`Class size`](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2010-2011-Class-Size-School-level-detail/urz7-pzb3) - Information` on class size for each school\n",
    "- [`AP test results`](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2010-AP-College-Board-School-Level-Results/itfs-ms3e) - Advanced Placement (AP) exam results for each high school (passing an optional AP exam in a particular subject can earn a student college credit in that subject)\n",
    "- [`Graduation outcomes`](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2005-2010-Graduation-Outcomes-School-Level/vh2h-md7a) - The percentage of students who graduated, and other outcome information\n",
    "- [`Demographics`](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2006-2012-School-Demographics-and-Accountability-S/ihfw-zy9j) - Demographic information for each school\n",
    "- [`School survey`](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2011-NYC-School-Survey/mnz3-dyi8) - Surveys of parents, teachers, and students at each school\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these data sets are interrelated. We'll need to combine them into a single data set before we can find correlations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we move into coding, we'll need to do some background research. A thorough understanding of the data will help us avoid costly mistakes, such as thinking that a column represents something other than what it does. Background research will also give us a better understanding of how to combine and analyze the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we'll want to research:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [New York City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City)\n",
    "- [The SAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAT)\n",
    "- [Schools in New York City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_high_schools_in_New_York_City)\n",
    "- [Our data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/browse?category=Education)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can learn a few different things from these resources. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Only high school students take the SAT, so we'll want to focus on high schools.\n",
    "- New York City is made up of five boroughs, which are essentially distinct regions.\n",
    "- New York City schools fall within several different school districts, each of which can contains dozens of schools.\n",
    "- Our data sets include several different types of schools. We'll need to clean them so that we can focus on high schools only.\n",
    "- Each school in New York City has a unique code called a `DBN`, or district borough number.\n",
    "- Aggregating data by district will allow us to use the district mapping data to plot district-by-district differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we proceed with the merge, we should make sure we have all of the data we want to unify. We mentioned the survey data earlier (survey_all.txt and survey_d75.txt), but we didn't read those files in because they're in a slightly more complex format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each survey text file looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "The files are tab delimited and encoded with `Windows-1252` encoding. An encoding defines how a computer stores the contents of a file in binary. The most common encodings are `UTF-8` and `ASCII`. `Windows-1252` is rarely used, and can cause errors if we read such a file in without specifying the encoding. If you'd like to read more about encodings, [here's](http://kunststube.net/encoding/) a good primer.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll need to specify the encoding and delimiter to the pandas `pandas.read_csv()` function to ensure it reads the surveys in properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "After we read in the survey data, we'll want to combine it into a single dataframe. We can do this by calling the `pandas.concat()` function:\n",
    "\n",
    "`z = pd.concat([x,y], axis=0)`\n",
    "\n",
    "The code above will combine dataframes `x` and `y` by essentially appending `y` to the end of `x`. The combined dataframe `z` will have the number of rows in `x` plus the number of rows in `y`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can generate this column, we'll need to convert the SAT Math Avg. Score, SAT Critical Reading Avg. Score, and SAT Writing Avg. Score columns in the sat_results data set from the object (string) data type to a numeric data type. We can use the [`pandas.to_numeric()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.17.0/generated/pandas.to_numeric.html) method for the conversion. If we don't convert the values, we won't be able to add the columns together.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to pass the keyword argument `errors=\"coerce\"` when we call `pandas.to_numeric()`, so that pandas treats any invalid strings it can't convert to numbers as missing values instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "After we perform the conversion, we can use the addition operator (`+`) to add all three columns together.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're almost ready to combine our data sets! We've come a long way in this mission -- we've gone from choosing a topic for a project to acquiring the data to having clean data that we're almost ready to combine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Along the way, we've learned how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Handle files with different formats and columns\n",
    "- Prepare to merge multiple files\n",
    "- Use text processing to extract coordinates from a string\n",
    "- Convert columns from strings to numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll always learn something new while working on a real-world data science project. Each project is unique, and there will always be quirks you don't quite know how to handle. The key is to be willing to try different approaches, and to have a general framework in your head for how to move from Step A to Step B.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next mission, we'll finish cleaning the data sets, then combine them so we can start our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "We now have a clean data set we can analyze! We've done a lot in this mission. We've gone from having several messy sources to one clean, combined, data set that's ready for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Along the way, we've learned about:\n",
    "\n",
    "How to handle missing values\n",
    "Different types of merges\n",
    "How to condense data sets\n",
    "How to compute averages across dataframes\n",
    "Data scientists rarely start out with tidy data sets, which makes cleaning and combining them one of the most critical skills any data professional can learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next mission, we'll analyze our clean data to find correlations and create maps.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Correlations\n",
    "Over the last two missions, we began investigating possible relationships between SAT scores and demographics. In order to do this, we acquired several data sets containing information about New York City public schools. We cleaned them, then combined them into a single data set named combined that we're now ready to analyze and visualize.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this mission, we'll discover correlations, create plots, and then make maps. The first thing we'll do is find any correlations between any of the columns and `sat_score`. This will help us determine which columns might be interesting to plot out or investigate further. Afterwards, we'll perform more analysis and make maps using the columns we've identified.\n",
    "\n",
    "### r_value\n",
    "Correlations tell us how closely related two columns are. We'll be using the [`r value`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient), also called [Pearson's correlation coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient), which measures how closely two sequences of numbers are correlated.\n",
    "\n",
    "An r value falls between `-1` and `1`. The value tells us whether two columns are positively correlated, not correlated, or negatively correlated. The closer to `1` the r value is, the stronger the positive correlation between the two columns. The closer to `-1` the r value is, the stronger the negative correlation (i.e., the more \"opposite\" the columns are). The closer to `0`, the weaker the correlation. To learn more about r values, see the statistics course.\n",
    "\n",
    "The columns in the following diagram have a strong positive correlation -- when the value in `class_size` is high, the corresponding value in `sat_score` is also high, and vice versa:\n",
    "\n",
    "The r value for the columns in the diagram above is `.99`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### df.corr()\n",
    "We can use the pandas [`pandas.DataFrame.corr()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.corr.html) method to find correlations between columns in a dataframe. The method returns a new dataframe where the index for each column and row is the name of a column in the original data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basemap\n",
    "We learned how to use the [`Basemap`](https://matplotlib.org/basemap/) package to create maps in the Visualizing Geographic Data mission. The Basemap package enables us to create high-quality maps, plot points over them, and then draw coastlines and other features.\n",
    "\n",
    "We extracted the coordinates for all of the schools earlier, and stored them in the lat and lon columns. The coordinates will enable us to plot all of the schools on a map of New York City.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can set up the map with this code:\n",
    "\n",
    "`from mpl_toolkits.basemap import Basemap\n",
    "m = Basemap(\n",
    "    projection='merc', \n",
    "    llcrnrlat=40.496044, \n",
    "    urcrnrlat=40.915256, \n",
    "    llcrnrlon=-74.255735, \n",
    "    urcrnrlon=-73.700272,\n",
    "    resolution='i'\n",
    ")`\n",
    "\n",
    "`m.drawmapboundary(fill_color='#85A6D9')\n",
    "m.drawcoastlines(color='#6D5F47', linewidth=.4)\n",
    "m.drawrivers(color='#6D5F47', linewidth=.4)`\n",
    "\n",
    "This code snippet will create a map that centers on New York City (`llcrnrlat`, `urcrnrlat`, `llcrnrlon`, and `urcrnrlon` define the corners of the geographic area the map depicts). It will also draw coastlines and rivers accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now all we need to do is convert our `lat` and `lon` coordinates to x and y coordinates so we can plot them on top of the map. This will show us where all of the schools in our data set are located.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you may recall, in order to plot coordinates using Basemap, we need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Convert the pandas series containing the latitude and longitude coordinates to lists using the `pandas.Series.tolist()` method.\n",
    "- Make a scatterplot using the `longitudes` and `latitudes` with the [`scatter()`](https://matplotlib.org/basemap/api/basemap_api.html#mpl_toolkits.basemap.Basemap.scatter) method on the Basemap object.\n",
    "- Show the plot using the `pyplot.show()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also need to make sure we pass a few keyword arguments to the scatter() method:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `s` - Determines the size of the point that represents each school on the map.\n",
    "- `zorder` - Determines where the method draws the points (that represent schools) on the z axis. In other words, it determines the order of the layers on the map. If we set zorder to 2, the method will draw the points on top of the continents, which is where we want them.\n",
    "- `latlon` - A Boolean value that specifies whether we're passing in latitude and longitude coordinates instead of x and y plot coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this mission, we found correlations, created visualizations, and mapped out our schools! Now we have all the tools we need to analyze the data in greater depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Along the way, we learned:\n",

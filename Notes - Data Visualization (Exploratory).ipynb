    "A discipline that focuses on the visual representation of data. As humans, our brains have evolved to develop powerful visual processing capabilities. We can quickly find patterns in the visual information we encounter, which was incredibly important from a survivability standpoint. Unfortunately, when data is represented as tables of values, we can't really take advantage of our visual pattern matching capabilities. This is because our ability to quickly process symbolic values (like numbers and words) is very poor. Data visualization focuses on transforming data from table representations visual ones."

    "\n",
    "To create the line chart, we'll use the matplotlib library, which allows us to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- quickly create common plots using high-level functions\n",
    "- extensively tweak plots\n",
    "- create new kinds of plots from the ground up\n",
    "\n",
    "**To help you become familiar with matplotlib, we'll focus on the first 2 use cases. When working with commonly used plots in matplotlib, the general workflow is**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- create a plot using data\n",
    "- customize the appearance of the plot\n",
    "- display the plot\n",
    "- edit and repeat until satisfied\n",
    "\n",
    "**This interactive style aligns well with the exploratory workflow of data visualization because we're asking questions and creating data visualizations to help us get answers.** The `pyplot` module provides a high-level interface for `matplotlib` that allows us to quickly create common data plots and perform common tweaks to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pyplot module is commonly imported as plt from matplotlib:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importing pyplot with matplotlib\n",
    "`import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the different pyplot functions, we can create, customize, and display a plot. For example, we can use 2 functions to :\n",
    "\n",
    "- `plt.plot()`\n",
    "- `plt.show()`\n",
    "\n",
    "### More with matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we didn't pass in any arguments, the `plot()` function would generate an empty plot with just the axes and ticks and the `show()` function would display that plot. You'll notice that we didn't assign the plot to a variable and then call a method on the variable to display it. We instead called 2 functions on the pyplot module directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because every time we call a pyplot function, the module maintains and updates the plot internally (also known as state). When we call `show()`, the plot is displayed and the internal state is destroyed. While this workflow isn't ideal when we're writing functions that create plots on a repeated basis as part of a larger application, it's useful when exploring data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's run this code to see the default properties matplotlib uses. If you'd like to follow along on your own computer, we recommend installing matplotlib using Anaconda: `conda install matplotlib`. We recommend working with matplotlib using Jupyter Notebook because it can render the plots in the notebook itself. You will need to run the following Jupyter magic in a code cell each time you open your notebook: `%matplotlib inline`. Whenever you call `show()`, the plots will be displayed in the output cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, Matplotlib displayed a coordinate grid with:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the x-axis and y-axis values ranging from -0.06 to 0.06\n",
    "- no grid lines\n",
    "- no data\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though no data was plotted, the `x-axis` and `y-axis` ticks correspond to the `-0.06` to `0.06` value range. The axis ticks consist of tick marks and tick labels. Here's a focused view of the x-axis tick marks and x-axis tick labels:\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of manually updating the ticks, drawing each marker, and connecting the markers with lines, we can just specify the data we want plotted and let matplotlib handle the rest. To generate the line chart we're interested in, we pass in the list of x-values as the first parameter and the list of y-values as the second parameter to `plot()`:\n",
    "\n",
    "`plt.plot(x_values, y_values)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib will accept any iterable object, like NumPy arrays and pandas.Series instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the y-axis looks fine, the **x-axis tick** labels are too close together and are unreadable. The line charts from earlier in the mission suggest a better way to display the x-axis tick labels:\n",
    "\n",
    "We can rotate the x-axis tick labels by 90 degrees so they don't overlap. The `xticks()` function within pyplot lets you customize the behavior of the x-axis ticks. If you head over to the documentation for that function, it's not immediately obvious the arguments it takes:\n",
    "\n",
    "`matplotlib.pyplot.xticks(*args, **kwargs)`\n",
    "\n",
    "In the documentation for the function, you'll see a link to the matplotlib Text class, which is what pyplot uses to represent the x-axis tick labels. You'll notice that there's a `rotation` parameter that accepts degrees of rotation as a parameter. We can specify degrees of rotation using a float or integer value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now finish tweaking this plot by adding axis labels and a title. Always adding axis labels and a title to your plot is a good habit to have, and is especially useful when we're trying to keep track of multiple plots down the road.\n",

    "When we were working with a single plot, pyplot was storing and updating the state of that single plot. We could tweak the plot just using the functions in the pyplot module. When we want to work with multiple plots, however, we need to be more explicit about which plot we're making changes to. This means we need to understand the matplotlib classes that pyplot uses internally to maintain state so we can interact with them directly. Let's first start by understanding what pyplot was automatically storing under the hood when we create a single plot:\n",
    "\n",
    "- a container for all plots was created (returned as a Figure object)\n",
    "- a container for the plot was positioned on a grid (the plot returned as an Axes object)\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "`fig = plt.figure()`\n",

    "`axes_obj = fig.add_subplot(nrows, ncols, plot_number)`\n",

    "\n",
    "`ax2 = fig.add_subplot(2,1,2)`\n",
    "\n",
    "This will create a grid, 2 rows by 1 column, of plots. Once we're done adding subplots to the figure, we display everything using `plt.show()`:\n",

    "`import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "fig = plt.figure()\n",

    "- the x-axis and y-axis values ranging from 0.0 to 1.0\n",
    "- no gridlines\n",
    "- no data\n",
    "The main difference is that this plot ranged from 0.0 to 1.0 instead of from -0.06 to 0.06, which is a quirk suggested by a difference in default properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have a basic understanding of the important matplotlib classes, we can create multiple plots to compare monthly unemployment trends. If you recall, we need to specify the position of each subplot on a grid. Here's a diagram that demonstrates how a 2 by 2 subplot layout would look like:\n",

It will also generate a line chart by default from the values passed in. Each time we want to generate a line chart, we need to call `Axes.plot()` and pass in the data we want to use in that plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "One issue with the 2 plots is that the x-axis ticks labels are unreadable. The other issue is that the plots are squeezed together vertically and hard to interpret. Even though now we generated 2 line charts, the total plotting area for the figure remained the same:\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because matplotlib used the default dimensions for the total plotting area instead of resizing it to accommodate the plots. If we want to expand the plotting area, we have to specify this ourselves when we create the figure. To tweak the dimensions of the plotting area, we need to use the `figsize` parameter when we call `plt.figure()`:\n",

    "\n",
    "By adding more line charts, we can look across more years for seasonal trends. This comes at a cost, unfortunately. We now have to visually scan over more space, which is a limitation that we experienced when scanning the table representation of the same data. If you recall, one of the limitations of the table representation we discussed in the previous mission was the amount of time we'd have to spend scanning the table as the number of rows increased significantly.\n",

Let's now move onto generating multiple line charts in the same subplot.\n",
    "\n",

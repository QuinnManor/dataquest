We can quickly find patterns in the visual information we encounter, which was incredibly important from a survivability standpoint. Unfortunately, when data is represented as tables of values, we can't really take advantage of our visual pattern matching capabilities. This is because our ability to quickly process symbolic values (like numbers and words) is very poor. Data visualization focuses on transforming data from table representations visual ones."

    "- create new kinds of plots from the ground up\n",

    "- create a plot using data\n",
    "- customize the appearance of the plot\n",
    "- display the plot\n",
    "- edit and repeat until satisfied\n",
    "\n",
    "**This interactive style aligns well with the exploratory workflow of data visualization because we're asking questions and creating data visualizations to help us get answers.** The `pyplot` module provides a high-level interface for `matplotlib` that allows us to quickly create common data plots and perform common tweaks to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pyplot module is commonly imported as plt from matplotlib:\n",

    "### Importing pyplot with matplotlib\n",

    "\n",
    "### More with matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we didn't pass in any arguments, the `plot()` function would generate an empty plot with just the axes and ticks and the `show()` function would display that plot. You'll notice that we didn't assign the plot to a variable and then call a method on the variable to display it. We instead called 2 functions on the pyplot module directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because every time we call a pyplot function, the module maintains and updates the plot internally (also known as state). When we call `show()`, the plot is displayed and the internal state is destroyed. While this workflow isn't ideal when we're writing functions that create plots on a repeated basis as part of a larger application, it's useful when exploring data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's run this code to see the default properties matplotlib uses. If you'd like to follow along on your own computer, we recommend installing matplotlib using Anaconda: `conda install matplotlib`. We recommend working with matplotlib using Jupyter Notebook because it can render the plots in the notebook itself. You will need to run the following Jupyter magic in a code cell each time you open your notebook: `%matplotlib inline`. Whenever you call `show()`, the plots will be displayed in the output cell.\n",

    "By default, Matplotlib displayed a coordinate grid with:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the x-axis and y-axis values ranging from -0.06 to 0.06\n",
    "- no grid lines\n",
    "- no data\n",

    "\n",
    "Instead of manually updating the ticks, drawing each marker, and connecting the markers with lines, we can just specify the data we want plotted and let matplotlib handle the rest. To generate the line chart we're interested in, we pass in the list of x-values as the first parameter and the list of y-values as the second parameter to `plot()`:\n",

    "We can rotate the x-axis tick labels by 90 degrees so they don't overlap. The `xticks()` function within pyplot lets you customize the behavior of the x-axis ticks. If you head over to the documentation for that function, it's not immediately obvious the arguments it takes:\n",

When we want to work with multiple plots, however, we need to be more explicit about which plot we're making changes to. This means we need to understand the matplotlib classes that pyplot uses internally to maintain state so we can interact with them directly. Let's first start by understanding what pyplot was automatically storing under the hood when we create a single plot:\n",

    "\n",
    "One issue with the 2 plots is that the x-axis ticks labels are unreadable. The other issue is that the plots are squeezed together vertically and hard to interpret. Even though now we generated 2 line charts, the total plotting area for the figure remained the same:\n",

    "This is because matplotlib used the default dimensions for the total plotting area instead of resizing it to accommodate the plots.

We now have to visually scan over more space, which is a limitation that we experienced when scanning the table representation of the same data.

    "A scatter plot helps us determine if 2 columns are weakly or strongly correlated. While calculating the `correlation coefficient` will give us a precise number, a scatter plot helps us find outliers, gain a more intuitive sense of how spread out the data is, and compare more easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "To generate a scatter plot, we use `Axes.scatter()`. The `scatter()` method has 2 required parameters, `x` and `y`, which matches the parameters of the `plot()` method. The values for these parameters need to be iterable objects of matching lengths (lists, NumPy arrays, or pandas series).\n",

    "The second scatter plot is a mirror reflection of the first scatter plot. The nature of the correlation is still reflected, however, which is the important thing. Let's now generate scatter plots to see how Fandango ratings correlate with all 3 of the other review sites.\n",
    "\n",
    "When generating multiple scatter plots for the purpose of comparison, it's important that all plots share the same ranges in the x-axis and y-axis. In the 2 plots we generated in the last step, the ranges for both axes didn't match. We can use `Axes.set_xlim()` and `Axes.set_ylim()` to set the data limits for both axes:\n",

    "\n",
    "By default, matplotlib uses the minimal ranges for the data limits necessary to display all of the data we specify. By manually setting the data limits ranges to specific ranges for all plots, we're ensuring that we can accurately compare. We can even use the methods we just mentioned to zoom in on a part of the plots. For example, the following code will limit the axes to the 4 to 5 range:\n",
    "\n",
    "`ax.set_xlim(4, 5)\n",
    "ax.set_ylim(4, 5)`\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes small changes in the actual values in the data appear larger in the plot. A difference of 0.1 in a plot that ranges from `0` to `5` is hard to visually observe. A difference of `0.1` in a plot that only ranges from `4` to `5` is easily visible since the difference is 1/10th of the range."
